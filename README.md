This is carpool management - a simple managment tool for schools to be able to monitor and keep track of school pick ups via QR code scanner.
It is supposed to scan the student ID embedded in the QR code that goes in the parent's car windshield.
The idea came to me as parent with privacy concern with the way schools are currently handling carpool pickups lanes with plain text student's information, which 
includes, student first and last names, grade and teacher's name.
Now, all of this display after scanning the unique student's ID and pushed off into different location in MySQL to be read.

Technologies in this tool:

PHP
MySQL
Javascript
HTML
