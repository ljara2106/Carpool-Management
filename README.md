# CarPool Management

This is carpool management - a simple managment tool for schools to be able to monitor dismissal via QR code scanner.
It is supposed to scan the student ID "embedded" in the QR code that goes in the parent's car windshield.
The idea came to me as parent with privacy concern with the way many schools are currently handling carpool pickups lanes with plain text student's information, which 
includes, student first and last names, grade and teacher's name.
Now, all of the student's information gets displayed after scanning the unique student's ID and then pushed off into different location in MySQL database to be read.

Pros:
- Privacy for student's information.
- No walkie talkies.
- No more paper tag prinout (can use QR code on phone)

Cons:
- Internet required...


Technologies in this tool:

-PHP
-MySQL
-Javascript
-HTML
-Ajax
