This is carpool management - a simple managment tool for schools to be able to monitor and keep track of school pick ups via QR code scanner.
It is supposed to scan the student ID embedded in the QR code that goes in the parent's car windshield.
The idea came to me as parent with privacy concern with the way schools are currently handling carpool pickups lanes with plain text student's information, which 
includes, student first, last, grade and teacher name
All of this would display after scanning the student's ID and pushed off into different location in MySQL.

Technologies in this tool:

PHP
MySQL
Javascript
HTML
